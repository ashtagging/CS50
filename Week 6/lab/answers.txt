Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As the number of simulations increased, so did the time taken to run the simulation

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10000 Simulations
